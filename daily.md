## Day 03

Took too long looking up how to do dumb things like turn a string into an array,
a letter into its ascii value, and intersections of arrays. (I originally had a
brute force looping construct for part one, when Array#intersection does the
job.

## Day 02

Using lookup tables feels a little like cheating, and would not be sustainable
with a larger data set. But for this, it works. With tables, there is no real
logic, just loop through the input and lookup on the tables.

## Day 01

Wasn't feeling well, so missed the start. Puzzle was straightforward, although I
bobbled a little on the project setup from last year. Going to try and document
a little better, so maybe next year it's not a big surprise. Rails has a nice
Array#split method that would have been great here, but it's not part of stock
Ruby. Perhaps I should start building my own library of this kind of thing.
