Day 01

Wasn't feeling well, so missed the start. Puzzle was straightforward, although I
bobbled a little on the project setup from last year. Going to try and document
a little better, so maybe next year it's not a big surprise. Rails has a nice
Array#split method that would have been great here, but it's not part of stock
Ruby. Perhaps I should start building my own library of this kind of thing.
